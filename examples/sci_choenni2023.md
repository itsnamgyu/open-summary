**Findings and Data Analysis**

The research paper discusses the extent to which multilingual large language models (MLLMs) rely on cross-lingual sharing of data for making predictions in specific test languages. The study uses a training data attribution (TDA) method to identify the most influential training samples and analyze the cross-lingual sharing mechanisms at the data level. The findings of the study reveal that MLLMs rely on data from multiple languages from the early stages of fine-tuning and this reliance gradually increases as fine-tuning progresses. The research also explores the influence of different fine-tuning languages on model performance for a given test language, indicating that languages can reinforce or complement the knowledge acquired from the test language itself.

**Language Dynamics and Cross-Lingual Sharing**

The paper presents a unique perspective by studying cross-lingual sharing at the data level and provides insights into the dynamics of how languages influence predictions for individual languages. The findings suggest that MLLMs exhibit a high degree of cross-lingual sharing and rely on data from languages other than the test language, even when the test language was seen during fine-tuning. The study also investigates the behavior of the model in a zero-shot testing scenario, where the test language was not seen during fine-tuning, and identifies different cross-lingual sharing patterns that emerge for languages in this setup.

**Impact of Language Data Imbalances**

Furthermore, the paper explores the impact of language data imbalances during training and reveals that the model still largely benefits from cross-lingual sharing even with data imbalances. The study provides comprehensive insights into the cross-lingual sharing behavior of multilingual models and highlights the significance of understanding the dynamics of cross-lingual data reliance for improving model performance in multilingual settings.

**Key Takeaways**

In summary, the research paper offers valuable insights into the cross-lingual sharing behavior of MLLMs and emphasizes the importance of studying data-level cross-lingual sharing dynamics for enhancing model performance in multilingual scenarios.
