**Introduction and Focus of the Study**

The paper explores the limitations of current machine learning systems and the potential of multitask learning and language models in a zero-shot setting for downstream natural language processing tasks. It emphasizes the need for general systems that are not sensitive to changes in data distribution and task specifications. The research demonstrates that language models can learn various tasks without explicit supervision when trained on a diverse dataset called WebText. The capacity of the language model is crucial for zero-shot task transfer, and its size relates to improved performance across tasks. The study introduces GPT-2, a 1.5B parameter Transformer model, which achieves state-of-the-art results in a zero-shot setting on several language modeling datasets. The paper also discusses the potential of multitask learning in natural language processing, emphasizing the need for training and measuring performance across a wide range of domains and tasks.

**Language Models in a Zero-Shot Setting**

The paper delves into the use of language models for specific tasks in a zero-shot setting, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization. The findings indicate that GPT-2 can achieve competitive performance in a zero-shot setting on tasks like question answering and translation. However, its performance in summarization, although qualitative, remains rudimentary according to quantitative metrics. Additionally, the paper discusses the importance of testing the performance of language models on various other tasks, which are yet to be evaluated. The research suggests that large language models trained on diverse datasets can potentially learn to perform a wide range of tasks without explicit supervision, but it highlights the need for further exploration and evaluation of these capabilities.
