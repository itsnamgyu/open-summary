### Abstract: Motivation, Goal, and Key Results

The paper focuses on training AI systems that remain helpful, honest, and harmless, even surpassing human-level performance. The authors introduce "Constitutional AI" (CAI), a method to train AI without human labels for identifying harmful outputs. This method employs both supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the supervised phase, the model generates self-critiques and revisions, followed by finetuning based on these revised responses. In the RL phase, a preference model is trained from AI-generated data to evaluate responses based on set principles, using RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF). The result is a harmless, non-evasive AI assistant capable of engaging with harmful queries and explaining its objections, enhancing human-judged performance and decision-making transparency with minimal human labels.

### Constitutional AI Approach

The Constitutional AI approach revolves around scaled supervision. Human supervision is replaced by a set of governing principles, combined with a few examples for few-shot prompting. The training process consists of two stages. The first stage, 'Supervised Stage,' involves generating responses to harmfulness prompts by a helpful AI assistant, critiquing these responses based on the constitution's principles, revising them, and finetuning the model on these revisions. This phase aims to align the model's responses with desired outcomes and reduce the need for exploration in the subsequent RL phase.

### Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback

The second stage, 'Reinforcement Learning Stage,' mimics Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) but replaces human preferences for harmlessness with AI feedback. In this stage, responses generated by the AI assistant trained in the first stage are evaluated by another AI model based on constitutional principles. This creates a preference dataset for harmlessness, which, combined with human feedback data for helpfulness, is used to train a preference model. This model then finetunes the assistant model from the first stage through RL, leading to a policy trained by RLAIF.

### Key Contributions

The paper highlights several significant contributions:

1. Improved harm identification by AI as language model capabilities enhance, with chain-of-thought reasoning making AI evaluations competitive with those based on human feedback.
2. The ability to apply model-generated critiques and revisions repeatedly to reduce harmfulness, addressing the evasiveness issue found in previous models.
3. The use of self-supervised preference labels for RL improves model behavior, as evaluated by crowdworkers, matching or exceeding the performance of models evaluated using human feedback for harmlessness.

### Extending Prior Techniques

The study builds upon prior work by training models using human feedback labels only for helpfulness. Harmlessness labels are generated by the language model itself, creating a more efficient process for training models that are both helpful and harmless. This method demonstrates a significant shift in training AI models, emphasizing the growing ability of AI systems to self-regulate and self-improve based on principles rather than relying heavily on human-generated data.
