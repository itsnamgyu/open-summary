**Introduction to Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM)**

The paper proposes the Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM), a multi-modal model intended to understand and follow speech and language instructions. The model is designed to address the limitations of existing large language models, which primarily focus on text input, by creating a model capable of processing speech and text instructions. LLaSM is trained in two stages, including modality adaptation pre-training and cross-modal instruction fine-tuning. The authors also release a large Speech Instruction Following dataset, LLaSM-Audio-Instructions, to supplement the scarcity of such cross-modal instruction data.

**LLaSM Model Capabilities and Features**

The LLaSM model leverages the Whisper speech encoder to encode audio signals into embeddings, and a modal adaptor aligns these embeddings with text input for further processing by the large language model. The authors emphasize the importance of speech as a natural and convenient mode of human-AI interaction and demonstrate the model's capabilities in processing both Chinese and English speech. Through their experiments, the authors show that LLaSM offers a more natural way for humans to interact with AI.

**Contributions and Future Work**

The contributions of the paper include the creation of LLaSM, the release of the LLaSM-Audio-Instructions dataset, and the provision of code and demo for the model. The authors highlight the potential for future work in combining visual and audio modalities for even broader applicability. Overall, the paper introduces LLaSM as a significant step toward understanding and following speech-and-language instructions, enhancing human-interaction with AI.
