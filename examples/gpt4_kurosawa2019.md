### Abstract: Motivation, Method, and Key Findings

**Dynamic Fusion in Neural Machine Translation**
The paper introduces "Dynamic Fusion," a novel mechanism in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) that integrates an attentive language model with the translation model. Prior approaches in NMT have used fixed-weight language models alongside translation models, often failing to consider the dynamic nature of language. The "Dynamic Fusion" mechanism, however, dynamically integrates the language model based on attention, leading to improved English-Japanese translation accuracy, as demonstrated by higher BLEU and RIBES scores. This method also ensures grammatical conformity and enhances the predictivity of the language model.

### Methodology of Dynamic Fusion

**How Dynamic Fusion Works**
Dynamic Fusion operates by fusing a translation model with an attentive language model, where the language model acts as an auxiliary element. This fusion is achieved by multiplying the language model’s prediction score with word attention. Unlike previous methods, Dynamic Fusion retains the independence of the language and translation models, allowing each to make predictions based on their own information. This approach enhances the translation output’s fluency and adequacy, as the attention mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of the language model.

### Key Point: Improvements Over Previous Models

**Advantages Over Shallow and Cold Fusion Mechanisms**
Compared to earlier models like Shallow Fusion and Cold Fusion, Dynamic Fusion offers significant improvements. Shallow Fusion used fixed weightings for language and translation models, while Cold Fusion dynamically determined these weights but allowed the language model to influence the translation model pre-prediction. Dynamic Fusion, in contrast, maintains the independence of each model, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate translations.

### Key Point: Experimental Results

**Empirical Evidence of Enhanced Translation Quality**
The paper presents empirical results showing that Dynamic Fusion outperforms baseline models and other fusion methods in English-Japanese translations. The experiments, using the Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus, demonstrate notable improvements in both BLEU and RIBES scores with Dynamic Fusion. These results confirm the mechanism's ability to enhance translation fluency and adequacy more effectively than previous methods.

### Key Point: Impact on Translation Fluency and Adequacy

**Balancing Fluency and Adequacy in Translations**
One of the critical achievements of Dynamic Fusion is its ability to improve the fluency of translations without sacrificing adequacy. This balance is particularly evident in examples provided in the paper, where translations using Dynamic Fusion are more natural and contextually accurate compared to those generated by baseline models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the attentional language model in producing translations that are not only fluent but also faithful to the source content.

### Conclusion

**Dynamic Fusion: A Step Forward in Machine Translation**
The paper concludes that Dynamic Fusion represents a significant advancement in the field of machine translation. By effectively integrating an attentive language model with a translation model, Dynamic Fusion provides a more nuanced and contextually aware translation process. This method surpasses previous fusion approaches, offering a promising direction for future research in NMT, particularly in dynamically adjusting the integration of language and translation models.
